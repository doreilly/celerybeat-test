To verify that celery and celerybeat are operating properly:

1. Create and activate a virtualenv --no-site-packages
2. clone this repo
3. install the requirements file:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. run celery
    - python manage.py celeryd -B
5. run the django server
    - python manage.py runserver
6. Open http://localhost:8000/test-celery-response/
    - expected response is "Status Code: 200"
    - if it returns a 50x status, celeryd isn't responding
7. Open http://localhost:8000/seconds-since-last-beat/
    - expected response is a number less than 10
    - if the number is greater than 10, celerybeat is not running the task as it should.
